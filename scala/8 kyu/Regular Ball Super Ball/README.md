# Regular Ball Super Ball

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu
```



# Instructions
Create a class Ball. Ball objects should accept one argument for "ball type" when instantiated.
If no arguments are given, ball objects should instantiate with a "ball type" of "regular."

Example:
```yaml
ball1 = new Ball();
ball2 = new Ball("super");

ball1.ballType     //=> "regular"
ball2.ballType     //=> "super"
```
