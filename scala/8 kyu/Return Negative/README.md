# Return Negative

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu
```



# Instructions
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:
```yaml
makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
```

Notes:
```yaml
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
```
