# Beginner - Lost Without a Map

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu
```

# Instructions
Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:
```yaml
[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]
```

For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.
