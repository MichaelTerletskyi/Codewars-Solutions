# Instructions

Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

```yaml
             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
```

Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

```yaml
1 -->  1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8
```
