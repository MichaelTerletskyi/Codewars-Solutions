# Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu

# Instructions
Your task is to make two functions, max and min (maximum and minimum in PHP and Python, maxi and mini in Julia) that take a(n) array/vector of integers list as input and outputs, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that array/vector.

#Examples
```yaml
max({4, 6, 2, 1, 9, 63, -134, 566}) returns 566
min({-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110}) returns -110
max({5}) returns 5
min({42, 54, 65, 87, 0}) returns 0
