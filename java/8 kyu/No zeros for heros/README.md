# No zeros for heros

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu
```

# Instructions
Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

They might be fun in your world, but not here.

Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

```yaml
1450 -> 145
960000 -> 96
1050 -> 105
-1050 -> -105
```

Zero alone is fine, don't worry about it. Poor guy anyway
