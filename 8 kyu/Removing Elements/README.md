# Removing Elements

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu
```



# Instructions
Take an array and remove every second element from the array.
Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:
```yaml
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
