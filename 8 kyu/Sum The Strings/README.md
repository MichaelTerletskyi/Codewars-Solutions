# Sum The Strings

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu
```

# Instructions

Create a function that takes 2 nonnegative integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

Example: (Input1, Input2 -->Output)

```yaml
"4",  "5" --> "9"
"34", "5" --> "39"
```

Notes:

- If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

- Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (2^31 - 1)
