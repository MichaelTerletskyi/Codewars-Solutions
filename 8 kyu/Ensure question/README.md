# Ensure question

```yaml
Level : 8 kyu
```

# Instructions

Given a string, write a function that returns the string with a question mark ("?") appends to the end, unless the original string ends with a question mark, in which case, returns the original string.

For example (Input --> Output)

```yaml
"Yes" --> "Yes?" 
"No?" --> "No?"
```
